	<h2>About</h2>

<p>
This website was created because I have probably over hundred localhost (private) pages with thousands and thousands of words HOWTOs, guides and tutorials plus any other type of information snippets for Linux Operating System, so I decided that why not share this info with everyone publicly. Main focus of this website is to keep my own Linux tutorials in one place with easy to find and read pages.
</p>

<p>
My first experience with Linux came in the early 1990s, cant remember what year this was, could have been mid 90s or even after that, for 100% sure I remember running my own home bare metal Linux Server already well before 1998 when I got my first internet "leased line" connection to my home. What I recall from those years is that it was either Red Hat or Debian Linux Server distribution.
</p>

<p>
Ever since the 1990s I have been running Linux Server, there might have been times when I had "a few" servers or very few times all of them happened to be down or migrating into the next phase in my Linux life, but all in all to make it short, I have always ran Linux Server 24/7.
</p>

<p>
My first experience with Linux Desktop came in fall of 2020 when I tried to migrate from Windows 8.1 to Linux Desktop on my daily editing and surfing computer (firefox, proprietary graphical editing tools for ofp/arma/falcon4/farming-simulator etc), however that was short lived because I could not get those disgusting proprietary windows softwares to work under Linux Desktop and I have been editing ofp/arma etc since the year 2000 and I wasn't (still aren't) ready to let go of that hobby, so I had to tuck my tail between my legs and limp back to disgusting horrible Windows 8.1 operating system.
</p>

<p>
I am not an Linux expert, farm from it. While I learned "ls -l", "ps ax", "rm", "top" etc commands already back in 1990s, there still has been months even some odd years that my Linux activity has been extremely low if not zero. For example after mid 2000s there might have been year or two when I only had Linux Server running by his lonesome without me logging on there in months as there was nothing for me to do. So yes technically I started learning Linux in the 1990s but still to this day I'm learning new stuff and if not always then at least almost always have to "google it up" when something specific comes up. However, so far I've not faced a Linux question/problem I could not solve in the end, so yeah.
</p>

<p>
This website is for myself as a personal "local notes", I just happen to publish/release all the info as web pages to the whole wide world (web? hoho) to read and hopefully learn something as well.
</p>

<p>
This website linux.pmctactical.org in my localhost computer was created last month I think, first git commit was from 2024-09-25T11:06:07Z and I'm typing this text on 2024-10-15T23:50:18Z so it took me a while to get this website creation properly started.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this website grows during the years of me running Linux Server and hopefully soon Linux Desktop 24/7 as well, every time I learn something new I will document it here for everyone to see. Hope you'll enjoy and find this website useful :)
